# Chatbot creation with Microsoft Azure Tutorial

We have created a tutorial to create a chatbot with Microsoft Azure. Indeed, we were able to create an Echo Chat bot and a Basic bot. We have then added additional functionalitiies such as the Language understanding (LUIS) and the Knowledgebase with the QnA Maker. We were also able to code ourself a chatbot, implement it to Azure and then finally connect it to Telegram.
